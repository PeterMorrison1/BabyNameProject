# BabyNameMovieThing

This project is intended to be a fun side-project to analyze baby names using Streamlit.

I currently have it extracting USA baby names by state, but I was thinking of possibly introducing Canadian provinces (ones that supply baby names at least). Additionally, I have a few other ideas for this project but I have not investigated if these ideas are feasible yet.

To run this project you should be able to clone the project, `pip install -r requirements` and run `streamlit run app.py`. To run the extracting code you would run the command `python setup.py install` then run the file `manual_download_usa_names.py` - this is because the extractor code is installed as a module.

This project will be available through Streamlit cloud as it is a public repo [at this link](https://share.streamlit.io/petermorrison1/babynameproject/main/app.py).
